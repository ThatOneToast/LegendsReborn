# Legends Reborn Plugin

Legends Reborn is a Minecraft plugin that introduces the first revision towards a RPG-style gameplay, all server-sided, eliminating the need for players to install mods to enjoy an enhanced gaming experience. Please note that this plugin is still in its early development stage, so expect to encounter some bugs during usage.

## Features

The plugin aims to enrich the gameplay by offering the following features:

1. **Weapons, Armor, and Abilities:** Legends Reborn brings a wide array of weapons and armor to amplify your character's power. Additionally, it introduces various abilities that add strategic elements to battles.

2. **Level Progression System:** Players can embark on a journey of progression as they level up their characters, unlocking new skills and abilities along the way.

3. **Mana System:** The plugin incorporates a mana system to manage the usage of powerful abilities and magic.

4. **Team Manager:** Legends Reborn includes a Team Manager feature, allowing players to create teams and invite others to join. This ensures that your abilities won't target your fellow team members during gameplay.

5. **Economy System:** An integrated economy system is built right into the plugin, eliminating the need for additional libraries or APIs.

6. **Auction House:** The plugin boasts a fully-fledged Auction House, designed from the ground up to facilitate player-to-player trading.

7. **Class System:** Players can choose from specific classes that define their play style. For example, one can become a formidable Barbarian, dealing high damage and boasting abundant health, or opt to play as a mage with powerful magic but lower health.

## Development Status

As of July 29th, 2023, Legends Reborn is primarily intended for use on a specific server and, therefore, has certain elements hard-coded. However, the development team plans to make the plugin fully customizable in the future, starting from the 2nd revision. This will enable server administrators to tailor the gameplay experience to suit their preferences.
